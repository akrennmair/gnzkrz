		<h3>What is krzz.de?</h3>
		<p>
			krzz.de is a tool to make URLs shorter. By entering a long URL, a new, shortened URL will be generated.
			When this shortened URL is opened in a browser, it will redirect to the original, long URL.
		</p>

		<h3>Why another URL shortener?</h3>
		<p>
			I created krzz.de for the following reasons:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>to create a technology demo for <a href="https://github.com/akrennmair/metoo-pm">MeToo.pm</a>, a nano web application framework for Perl.</li>
			<li>to gain experience with the development and maintenance of real "live" web services.</li>
			<li>to test how far I can bring this service while only hosting it on the shared webhosting servers of webhosting provider.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			krzz.de is powered by <a href="https://github.com/akrennmair/gnzkrz">gnzkrz</a>, which is open source software and licensed under the
			MIT/X Consortium License.

		<h3>Does your service provide an API to automate URL shortening?</h3>
		<p>Yes. Just make GET requests on
<pre>
http://krzz.de/_api/save?url=&lt;your-url&gt;
</pre>
			and the returned body will contain the shortened URL in <tt>text/plain</tt> MIME type.
