		<h1>What is krzz.de?</h1>
		<p>
			krzz.de is a tool to make URLs shorter. By entering a long URL, a new, shortened URL will be generated.
			When this shortened URL is opened in a browser, it will redirect to the original, long URL.

		<h1>Why another URL shortener?</h1>
		<p>
			I created krzz.de for the following reasons:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>to create a technology demo for <a href="https://github.com/akrennmair/metoo-pm">MeToo.pm</a>, a nano web application framework for Perl.</li>
			<li>to gain experience with the development and maintenance of real "live" web services.</li>
			<li>to test how far I can bring this service while only hosting it on the shared webhosting servers of webhosting provider.</li>
		</ol>

		<h1>Your service links to illegal/indecent content.</h1>
		<p>
			Please send an email to <a 
			href="mailto:admin@krzz.de">admin@krzz.de</a> so that I can 
			disable abuse links as soon as possible.
